# Language-agnostic: it does NOT run any project quality gate. Run the gate
# yourself (per the project's AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md) BEFORE `pr.sh push`.

# Subcommands:
#   start <branch>        create <branch> in a FRESH git worktree off up-to-date origin/BASE
#                         (a sibling directory next to the repo, never the shared checkout)
#                         and print its path — cd there for every remaining step.
#   push <branch>         requires REVIEWED=1 (run pr-review-toolkit:review-pr and fix what it
#                         flags first); then explicit-refspec push + verify branch landed &
#                         BASE didn't move
#   open <title> [body]   gh pr create --base BASE (body = path to a markdown file), print URL, STOP
#   threads <pr>          list UNRESOLVED review threads on a PR (work them one by one)
#   reviews <pr>           list PR-LEVEL review comments (the "Overall Comments" a bot leaves on
#                          the review itself, not on a line — these have no thread and can't be
#                          replied to with `reply`). Pulls out each bot's "Prompt for AI Agent(s)"
#                          block when present, since that's the actionable part.
#   comment <pr> <body>   post a general/top-level PR comment, not tied to any review thread
#                         (body = inline string or path to a markdown file); use this to
#                         respond to PR-level reviews (from `reviews`) that have no thread.
#                         ALWAYS use quote-reply format so it is clear which part you address:
#                           pr.sh comment 27 "> quoted text from the review
#                           Your response here."
#   comment-delete <id>   delete a general/top-level PR comment by its numeric id (from the
#                         URL printed by `comment`, or an id you already have) — the correction
#                         path when a `comment` needs fixing, since GitHub comments can't be
#                         edited via `gh pr comment`
#   reply <pr> <id> <body> reply to a review thread comment (body = inline string or path to a markdown file)
#   cleanup               once a task is FULLY done (PR merged or abandoned — not right after
#                         opening; the review loop still needs this worktree): verify it's
#                         pristine, remove it, and print the main checkout's path to cd back
#                         into. Only ever removes a worktree under the exact <repo>-worktrees
#                         root `start` creates. NON-DESTRUCTIVE — if dirty (including gitignored
#                         files the removal would otherwise silently take with it) it reports
#                         and stops (never discards).
#
# Env:
#   BASE                  base branch (default: main). The skill supplies this from the project's docs.
#   DRAFT                 set DRAFT=1 to open the PR as a draft (bots typically don't review drafts).
#   DRY_RUN               set DRY_RUN=1 so `open` prints the gh command instead of creating the PR.
#   FORCE_REMOVE_IGNORED  set to 1 to let `cleanup` remove a worktree that still has gitignored
#                         files in it (otherwise it refuses, since removal deletes the whole
#                         directory — build artifacts are fine to lose, a stray .env isn't).
#   REVIEWED              set to 1 to confirm pr-review-toolkit:review-pr has been run on the
#                         changes and anything it flagged has been addressed. `push` refuses to
#                         run without it — self-review before push catches what bots would flag
#                         anyway, just before it's public on the PR instead of after.
#   PR_BOT_DOPPLER_PROJECT / PR_BOT_DOPPLER_CONFIG  Doppler project/config holding the agent
#                         identity secrets below (default: common/dev). Every gh call and every
#                         commit this script makes uses this identity, NEVER whatever personal
#                         `gh auth`/git identity happens to be ambient — that's what silently
#                         leaked a personal account into commits/PR comments before this existed.
#                         Requires GITHUB_AGENT_PATC (a gh token), GITHUB_AGENT_USERNAME, and
#                         GITHUB_AGENT_EMAIL to exist in that Doppler config. Fetched fresh on
#                         every invocation (never cached to disk); if Doppler/the secrets aren't
#                         reachable, every subcommand dies loudly rather than falling back to
#                         the ambient identity.
